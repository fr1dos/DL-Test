# Traveling Salesman Problem using Branch And Bound
Given a train schedule(test_task_data.csv) between several stations in the format "train number; departure station; arrival station; cost; departure time; arrival time" (it is guaranteed that there are no trips longer than a day). You need to get the "best" options (several, if possible) for traveling between all stations so that you visit each station once. Request the best options:
 - Best in price
 - Best in terms of time
